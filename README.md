# READING NOTES
Notes for CodeX


Hello! My name is Shen√®a Dorsey and I'm beyond thrilled to be a part of this program. I've always preferred to work in creative fields such as the entertainment industry or event planning, but I've been keen on the tech world for a while now. I'm so excited to learn a new skill and start a new chapter in my life. What I'm looking forward to the most from this opportunity is learning how to mix my passion for creating experiences and my new technical knowledge to open my world to new job opportunities. 


## GROWTH MINDSET

To me, the concept of a "growth mindset" is essentially the idea that "you can do anything you put your mind to." I'm sure most of us heard this growing up (especially millennials), and while this is a beautiful and inspirational sentiment it appears that most people do not find this to be their belief. It seems that people (sometimes myself included) start to lose patience and get frustrated when they're not achieving what they set out for in a timely manner. From there the lack of patience and small frustrations can turn into crippling self-doubt or just flat-out giving up. In order to combat these feelings of inadequacy, I believe having a "growth mindset" is one of the most important tools you can have in your arsenal. I find the main elements of a growth mindset are having self-confidence, determination, and being willing to constantly learn. If you're able to change your perspective around the obstacles that try to stand in between you and your ultimate goals, then it will be harder to forget that nothing outweighs the pleasure of knowing your successes came from your own determination and hard work.
